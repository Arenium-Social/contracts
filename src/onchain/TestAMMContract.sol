/**
 * @title Test_AMMContract
 * @notice Simplified Automated Market Maker for testing prediction market functionality
 * @dev This contract implements a basic constant product AMM (x * y = k) for testing purposes.
 *      It provides liquidity pools, token swapping, and position management without the complexity
 *      of Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity model.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Simple constant product formula for price discovery
 * - Basic liquidity provision and removal
 * - Token swapping with slippage protection
 * - Pool creation and management for prediction market tokens
 * - User position tracking
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Built for testing prediction market outcome tokens
 * - Uses simplified reserve-based liquidity model
 * - Maintains compatibility with main contract interfaces
 * - No external dependencies beyond OpenZeppelin
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Uses safe token transfers via IERC20
 * - Implements slippage protection for swaps and liquidity operations
 * - Owner-only functions for emergency management
 * - Simple validation for pool creation and operations
 *
 * Gas Optimizations:
 * - Simplified calculations compared to Uniswap V3
 * - Efficient storage patterns with mappings
 * - Minimal external calls
 *
 * @custom:testing This contract is designed for testing and development purposes only
 * @custom:amm Implements simplified constant product AMM formula (x * y = k)
