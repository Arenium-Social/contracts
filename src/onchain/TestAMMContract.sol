/**
 * @title Test_AMMContract
 * @author Arenium Social
 * @notice Simplified automated market maker contract for testing prediction market functionality
 * @dev This is a testing version that implements a basic constant product AMM (x * y = k) instead
 *      of the complex Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity model. It provides essential AMM functionality
 *      for creating pools, managing liquidity, and executing swaps between outcome tokens.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Simple constant product formula for token swapping
 * - Basic liquidity provision and removal
 * - Pool creation and management for prediction markets
 * - User position tracking
 * - Slippage protection on swaps
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Built on constant product AMM model (x * y = k)
 * - Simplified reserve-based liquidity tracking
 * - Direct token transfers without complex callbacks
 * - Compatible interface with the main AMM contract
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Safe token transfers using OpenZeppelin's IERC20
 * - Slippage protection on all swap operations
 * - Owner-only emergency functions
 * - Input validation on all public functions
 *
 * Gas Optimizations:
 * - Simple mathematical operations
 * - Efficient storage patterns with mappings
 * - Minimal external calls
 *
 * @custom:testing This contract is designed for testing purposes and uses simplified logic
 * @custom:compatibility Maintains interface compatibility with the main AMM contract
 * @custom:formula Uses constant product formula: reserveA * reserveB = k (constant)
