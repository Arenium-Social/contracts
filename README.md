# Arenium

Welcome to **Arenium**, a modular and community-powered **decentralized prediction market protocol** built on the **Base** network. Arenium lets users create, participate in, and trade on high-stakes markets across crypto trends, sports, politics, and more — with built-in **liquidity**, **trustless resolution**, and **reward mechanisms**.

Arenium leverages:

- **UMA’s Optimistic Oracle V3** for trustless event resolution,
- **Uniswap V3 liquidity pools** for outcome token trading,
- A custom-built **AMM management contract**, and
- An upcoming **FeeHandler contract** to distribute market fees efficiently.

## Overview

### 🧠 What Is Arenium?

Arenium is a Web3-native platform where anyone can:

1. **Create new prediction markets**
2. **Mint outcome tokens**
3. **Provide liquidity to Uniswap V3 pools**
4. **Trade and speculate on outcomes**
5. **Assert event outcomes through UMA**
6. **Claim rewards after market resolution**

All without relying on centralized oracles, custodians, or intermediaries.

### Key Features

1. **Event Resolution via UMA Optimistic Oracle V3:**

   - Ensures secure and trustless settlement of event outcomes.
   - Supports off-chain data resolution for a wide range of markets.
   - Minimizes reliance on centralized oracles, enhancing decentralization.

2. **Automated Market Maker (AMM):**

   - Facilitates seamless trading of outcome tokens using a liquidity pool and pricing curve.
   - Implements dynamic token pricing based on supply and demand.
   - Ensures liquidity for all markets, enabling efficient trading.

3. **PredictionMarketManager Contract:**

   - Manages the lifecycle of prediction markets.
   - Facilitates market creation, event resolution w/ UMA Optimalistic Oracle V3.

4. **Fee Collection and Distribution:**

   - Transparent and configurable fee structure for market creation, trading, and settlement.
   - Supports treasury or community-driven fee allocation.
   - Fees are distributed fairly to incentivize participation and growth.

5. **Supported Tokens:**

   - Uses USDT, USDC, BTC, AVAX, and WETH as primary tokens for placing bets, providing liquidity, and earning rewards.
   - Ensures compatibility with widely-used assets for ease of use.

6. **Community-Centric Design:**

   - Features gamified elements like leaderboards, exclusive challenges, and rewards for The Arena users.
   - Encourages community participation through decentralized governance and feedback mechanisms.

7. **Built on the Avalanche Network:**
   - Leverages low transaction costs, high scalability, and robust smart contract infrastructure.
     Ensures fast and efficient market operations for a seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Create or Explore Markets:** Browse existing markets or create new ones with custom outcomes.
2. **Mint Outcome Tokens:** Deposit supported tokens to mint tokens representing different outcomes.
3. **Trade on AMM:** Use the AMM to buy or sell outcome tokens based on your predictions.
4. **Participate in Settlement:** UMA’s Optimistic Oracle V3 resolves event outcomes to finalize markets.
5. **Earn Rewards:** Accurate predictions lead to token payouts, leaderboard rankings, and more.
